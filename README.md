A collection of ready-to-run Python\* notebooks for learning, and experimenting with the OpenVINO Developer Tools. The notebooks are meant to provide an introduction to OpenVINO basics, and teach developers how to build your own applications that use our APIs for optimized deep learning inference.

## Getting Started

## System Requirements

> **NOTE**: Python 3.8 on Linux operating systems is not supported yet. If you wish to run the notebooks on Ubuntu 20.04, please see our [guide](wiki_url) for installing Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 20.04.
