    "LCMs: The next generation of generative models after Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). \n",
    "Latent Diffusion models (LDMs) have achieved remarkable results in synthesizing high-resolution images. However, the iterative sampling is computationally intensive and leads to slow generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469), [Latent Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04378.pdf) (LCMs) were proposed, enabling swift inference with minimal steps on any pre-trained LDMs, including Stable Diffusion. \n",
    "The [Consistency Model (CM) (Song et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469) is a new family of generative models that enables one-step or few-step generation. The core idea of the CM is to learn the function that maps any points on a trajectory of the PF-ODE (probability flow of [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)) to that trajectory’s origin (i.e., the solution of the PF-ODE). By learning consistency mappings that maintain point consistency on ODE-trajectory, these models allow for single-step generation, eliminating the need for computation-intensive iterations. However, CM is constrained to pixel space image generation tasks, making it unsuitable for synthesizing high-resolution images. LCMs adopt a consistency model in the image latent space for generation high-resolution images.  Viewing the guided reverse diffusion process as solving an augmented probability flow ODE (PF-ODE), LCMs are designed to directly predict the solution of such ODE in latent space, mitigating the need for numerous iterations and allowing rapid, high-fidelity sampling. Utilizing image latent space in large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD) has effectively enhanced image generation quality and reduced computational load. The authors of LCMs provide a simple and efficient one-stage guided consistency distillation method named Latent Consistency Distillation (LCD) to distill SD for few-step (2∼4) or even 1-step sampling and propose the SKIPPING-STEP technique to further accelerate the convergence. More details about proposed approach and models can be found in [project page](https://latent-consistency-models.github.io/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04378) and [original repository](https://github.com/luosiallen/latent-consistency-model).\n",

    "In this tutorial we will use [LCM_Dreamshaper_v7](https://huggingface.co/SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7) from [HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/). This model distilled from [Dreamshaper v7](https://huggingface.co/Lykon/dreamshaper-7) fine-tune of [Stable-Diffusion v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) using Latent Consistency Distillation (LCD) approach discussed above. This model is also integrated into [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library. 🤗 Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. This allows us to compare running original Stable Diffusion (from this [notebook](../225-stable-diffusion-text-to-image)) and distilled using LCD. The distillation approach efficiently converts a pre-trained guided diffusion model into a latent consistency model by solving an augmented PF-ODE.\n",
