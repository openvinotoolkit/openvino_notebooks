Getting Started
===============

Welcome to this documentation's Getting Started section! Here you will find all the information necessary to get started with Anomalib. In this section, we'll walk you through the installation process step-by-step, so you should be able to follow along even if you're new to this field. We've made the installation process as simple and straightforward as possible, but if you encounter any problems or have questions along the way, please ask your question in `Anomalib Discussions <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib/discussions>`_. After the installation process is complete, you will be able to utilise the library to its fullest extent. You can then proceed to the other sections of this documentation to learn more about its capabilities and features. Let's get started!
