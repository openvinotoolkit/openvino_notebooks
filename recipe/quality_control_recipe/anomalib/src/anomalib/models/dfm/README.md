# Probabilistic Modeling of Deep Features for Out-of-Distribution and Adversarial Detection

This is the implementation of [DFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11786.pdf) paper.

Model Type: Classification

## Description

Fast anomaly classification algorithm that consists of a deep feature extraction stage followed by anomaly classification stage consisting of PCA and class-conditional Gaussian Density Estimation.

### Feature Extraction

Features are extracted by feeding the images through a ResNet18 backbone, which was pre-trained on ImageNet. The output of the penultimate layer (average pooling layer) of the network is used to obtain a semantic feature vector with a fixed length of 2048.

### Anomaly Detection

In the anomaly classification stage, class-conditional PCA transformations and Gaussian Density models are learned. Two types of scores are calculated (i) Feature-reconstruction scores (norm of the difference between the high-dimensional pre-image of a reduced dimension feature and the original high-dimensional feature), and (ii) Negative log-likelihood under the learnt density models. Anomaly map generation is supported only with the feature-reconstruction based scores. Image level anomaly detection is supported by both score types.

## Usage

`python tools/train.py --model dfm`

## Benchmark

All results gathered with seed `42`.

> Note: Metrics for ResNet 18 were calculated with pooling kernel size of 2 while for Wide ResNet 50, kernel size of 4 was used.
