    "# Tiling Large Images\n",
    "In the literature on deep learning, input image sizes typically range from 224 to 768 pixels. In the majority of industrial applications, however, input image sizes are significantly larger. Before the forward pass, these images are resized to a smaller scale before being fed into the models. However, this is problematic in the context of anomaly detection tasks, where the anomaly is typically quite small. The detection of abnormalities becomes extremely difficult when the image is shrunk in size. A common method for addressing this issue is to tile the input images so that no information is lost during the resizing operation.\n",

The `Tiler` object also returns the coordinates of the patches in the original image. This is useful for reconstructing the tiled image back into the original image. Let's create a tiler object, tile the input image and visualize the tiled image."
