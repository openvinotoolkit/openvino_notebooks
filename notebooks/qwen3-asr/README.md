# Qwen3-ASR Speech Recognition with OpenVINO™

The Qwen3-ASR family includes Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B, which support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding capability of their foundation model, Qwen3-Omni. Experiments show that the 1.7B version achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary commercial APIs. Here are the main features:

* **All-in-one**: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B support language identification and speech recognition for 30 languages and 22 Chinese dialects, so as to English accents from multiple countries and regions.

* **Excellent and Fast**: The Qwen3-ASR family ASR models maintains high-quality and robust recognition under complex acoustic environments and challenging text patterns. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves strong performance on both open-sourced and internal benchmarks. While the 0.6B version achieves accuracy-efficient trade-off, it reaches 2000 times throughput at a concurrency of 128. They both achieve streaming / offline unified inference with single model and support transcribe long audio.

* **Novel and strong forced alignment Solution**: We introduce Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B, which supports timestamp prediction for arbitrary units within up to 5 minutes of speech in 11 languages. Evaluations show its timestamp accuracy surpasses E2E based forced-alignment models.

* **Comprehensive inference toolkit**: In addition to open-sourcing the architectures and weights of the Qwen3-ASR series, we also release a powerful, full-featured inference framework that supports vLLM-based batch inference, asynchronous serving, streaming inference, timestamp prediction, and more.

### Notebook Contents

In this tutorial we consider how to run and optimize Qwen3-ASR using OpenVINO.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- Install prerequisites
- Convert model to OpenVINO intermediate representation (IR) format 
- Prepare OpenVINO Inference pipeline
- Run Speech Recognition
- Launch interactive demo

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For further details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL NOTEBOOK**

This notebook demonstrates a model that has not been fully validated with OpenVINO. It may be fully supported and validated in the future.
