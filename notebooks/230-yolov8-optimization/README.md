## Notebook Contents

This tutorial demonstrates step-by-step instructions on how to run and optimize PyTorch\* Yolo V8 with OpenVINO.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:
- Prepare PyTorch model
- Download and prepare dataset
- Validate original model
- Convert PyTorch model to OpenVINO IR
- Validate converted model
- Prepare and run NNCF Postraining optimization pipeline
- Compare accuracy of the FP32 and quantized models
- Compare performance of the FP32 and quantized models
