# Create LLM-powered Chatbot using OpenVINO

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations. 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant responses.
While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic, one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions, LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable accuracy.

Previously, we already discussed how to build instruction-following pipeline using OpenVINO and Optimum Intel, please check out [Dolly v2 example](../240-dolly-2-instruction-following) for reference.
In this tutorial we consider how to use power of OpenVINO for running Large Language Models for both chat and QA over document. We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format. In addition, we will use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) to augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data, which allow you to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a modelâ€™s cutoff date.

The tutorial supports different models, you can select one from provided options to compare quality of open source LLM solutions.
>**Note**: conversion of some models can require additional actions from user side and at least 64GB RAM for conversion.

The available options are:

* **tiny-llama-1b-chat** - This is the chat model finetuned on top of [TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T). The TinyLlama project aims to pretrain a 1.1B Llama model on 3 trillion tokens with the adoption of the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2. This means TinyLlama can be plugged and played in many open-source projects built upon Llama. Besides, TinyLlama is compact with only 1.1B parameters. This compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint. More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0).
*  **mini-cpm-2b-dpo** - MiniCPM is an End-Size LLM developed by ModelBest Inc. and TsinghuaNLP, with only 2.4B parameters excluding embeddings.

* **mpt-7b-chat** - MPT-7B is part of the family of MosaicPretrainedTransformer (MPT) models, which use a modified transformer architecture optimized for efficient training and inference. These architectural changes include performance-optimized layer implementations and the elimination of context length limits by replacing positional embeddings with Attention with Linear Biases ([ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409)). Thanks to these modifications, MPT models can be trained with high throughput efficiency and stable convergence. MPT-7B-chat is a chatbot-like model for dialogue generation. It was built by finetuning MPT-7B on the [ShareGPT-Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered), [HC3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3), [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca), [HH-RLHF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf), and [Evol-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/victor123/evol_instruct_70k) datasets.
