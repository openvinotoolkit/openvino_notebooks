    "> **Note:** This notebook has been moved to a new branch named \"latest\". [Click here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/llm-chatbot/rag-chatbot.ipynb) to get the most updated version of the notebook. This branch is deprecated.\n",

    "**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. In this tutorial, we’ll build a simple question-answering application over a Markdown or CSV data source.\n",

    "Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models) and create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging Face Transformers models.  This means we just need to replace `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `OVModelForXxx` class.\n",

    "\n",
    "To optimize the generation process and use memory more efficiently, the `use_cache=True` option is enabled. Since the output side is auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the same once computed for every further generation step. Therefore, recomputing it every time you want to generate a new token seems wasteful. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state once it has been computed. The model only computes the one for the most recently generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved ones for hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ for a transformer model. More details about how it works can be found in this [article](https://scale.com/blog/pytorch-improvements#Text%20Translation). With this option, the model gets the previous step's hidden states (cached attention keys and values) as input and additionally provides hidden states for the current step as output. It means for all next iterations, it is enough to provide only a new token obtained from the previous step and cached key values to get the next token prediction. \n",
