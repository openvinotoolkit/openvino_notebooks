    "## Kidney Segmentation with PyTorch Lightning and OpenVINO™ - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of a series on how to train, optimize, quantize and show live inference on a medical segmentation model. The goal is to accelerate inference on a kidney segmentation model. The [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) model is trained from scratch; the data is from [KiTS19](https://github.com/neheller/kits19).\n",
    "\n",
    " The KiTS19 Nifty images are 3D files. Kidney segmentation is a relatively simple case for neural networks - it is expected that a 2D neural network should work quite well. 2D networks are smaller, and easier to work with than 3D networks, and image data is easier to work with than Nifty files. \n",
    "\n",
    "This first tutorial in the series shows how to:\n",
    " \n",
    "- load Nifty images and get the data as array,\n",
    "- apply windowing to a CT scan to increase contrast,\n",
    "- convert Nifty data to 8-bit images.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This will not result in the best kidney segmentation model. Optimizing the kidney segmentation model is outside the scope of this tutorial. The goal is to have a small model that works reasonably well, as a starting point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must download the dataset from [KiTS19](https://github.com/neheller/kits19) with the code below. First, clone the repository and install the requirements. It is recommended to install the requirements in the `openvino_env` virtual environment.\n",

    "   python -m starter_code.get_imaging\n",

    "\n",
    "**The code above will take a long time to run. The downloaded content takes up around 21GB of data, and the converted images around 3.5GB**. Downloading the full dataset is only required if you want to train the model yourself.
