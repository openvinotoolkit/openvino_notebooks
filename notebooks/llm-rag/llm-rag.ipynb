    "# Create a RAG system using OpenVINO and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. In this tutorial, we’ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install prerequisites\n",
    "- Download and convert the model from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).\n",
    "- Compress model weights to 4-bit or 8-bit data types using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf)\n",
    "- Create a RAG chain pipeline\n",
    "- Run Q&A pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the customized RAG pipeline consists of following components in order, where embedding, rerank and LLM will be deployed with OpenVINO to optimize their inference performance.\n",

Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in prediction quality.\n",

    "You can also apply fp16, 8-bit or 4-bit weight compression on the Linear, Convolutional and Embedding layers when exporting your model with the CLI by setting `--weight-format` to respectively fp16, int8 or int4. This type of optimization allows to reduce the memory footprint and inference latency.\n",
    "By default the quantization scheme for int8/int4 will be [asymmetric](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#asymmetric-quantization), to make it [symmetric](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#symmetric-quantization) you can add `--sym`.\n",

    "- The `--group-size` parameter will define the group size to use for quantization, -1 it will results in per-column quantization.\n",
    "- The `--ratio` parameter controls the ratio between 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. If set to 0.9, it means that 90% of the layers will be quantized to int4 while 10% will be quantized to int8.\n",
