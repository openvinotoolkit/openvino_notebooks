In this tutorial speech to text recognition is presented.

## Notebook Contents

In this tutorial, we use the [quartznet 15x5](https://docs.openvino.ai/2021.4/omz_models_model_quartznet_15x5_en.html) model. QuartzNet performs automatic speech recognition. Its design is based on the Jasper architecture, which is a convolutional model trained with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. The model is available from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/).
