## Notebook contents
The tutorial consists from following steps:
- Installations
- Imports
- Prepare base model
- Initialize model
- PyTorch inference
- Initialize model
- SpeechBrain model optimization with Intel OpenVINO
    - Step 1: Prepare input tensor
    - Step 2: Convert model to OpenVINO IR
    - Step 3: OpenVINO model inference

## Installation instructions
This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
