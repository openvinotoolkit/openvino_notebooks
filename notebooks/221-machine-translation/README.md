Machine translation is a form of natural language processing that translates sentences from one language to another.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates machine translation from English to German using
[machine-translation-nar-en-de-0002](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/intel/machine-translation-nar-en-de-0002/README.md)
from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo).
The last cell is interactive, so you can type sentences in English that will be translated to German.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
