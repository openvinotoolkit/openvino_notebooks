Machine translation is a form of natural language processing that translates sentences from one language to another.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates machine translation from English to German using

from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo).
The last cell is interactive, so you can type sentences in English that will be translated to German.
