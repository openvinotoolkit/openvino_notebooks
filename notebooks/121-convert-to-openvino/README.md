This notebook shows how to convert a model from its original framework format to the OpenVINO IR. It describes the Python conversion API and the OpenVINO Model Converter command-line tool. It provides examples of converting Hugging Face and PyTorch models to OpenVINO IR.

## Notebook Contents

The OpenVINO IR conversion tutorial consists of the following content:

* OpenVINO IR format
* Fetching example models
* Conversion
    * Setting Input Shapes
    * Compressing a Model to FP16
    * Converting Models from Memory
* Migration from Legacy Conversion API
    * Specifying Layout
    * Changing Model Layout
    * Specifying Mean and Scale Values
    * Reversing Input Channels
    * Cutting Off Parts of a Model

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.

We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
