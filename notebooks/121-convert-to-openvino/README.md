This notebook shows how to convert model from original framework format to the OpenVINO IR. It describes Python conversion API and Model Optimizer command-line tool. It provides examples of Hugging Face and Pytorch models conversion to OpenVINO IR.

## Notebook Contents

The OpenVINO IR conversion tutorial consists of the following content:

* OpenVINO IR format
* IR preparation with Python conversion API and Model Optimizer command-line tool
* Fetching example models
* Basic conversion
* Model conversion parameters
  * Setting Input Shapes
  * Cutting Off Parts of a Model
  * Embedding Preprocessing Computation
    * Specifying Layout
    * Changing Model Layout
    * Specifying Mean and Scale Values
    * Reversing Input Channels
  * Compressing a Model to FP16
* Convert Models Represented as Python Objects

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.

We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
