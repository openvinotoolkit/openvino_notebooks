    "# Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion v2 and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion v2 is the next generation of Stable Diffusion model a Text-to-Image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). \n",
    "\n",
    "General diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to denoise random gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an image.\n",
    "Diffusion models have shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for generating image data. But one downside of diffusion models is that the reverse denoising process is slow. In addition, these models consume a lot of memory because they operate in pixel space, which becomes unreasonably expensive when generating high-resolution images. Therefore, it is challenging to train these models and also use them for inference. OpenVINO brings capabilities to run model inference on Intel hardware and opens the door to the fantastic world of diffusion models for everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks, we already discussed how to run [Text-to-Image generation and Image-to-Image generation using Stable Diffusion v1](../stable-diffusion-text-to-image/stable-diffusion-text-to-image.ipynb) and [controlling its generation process using ControlNet](./controlnet-stable-diffusion/controlnet-stable-diffusion.ipynb). Now is turn of Stable Diffusion v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stable Diffusion v2: What’s new?\n",
    "\n",
    "The new stable diffusion model offers a bunch of new features inspired by the other models that have emerged since the introduction of the first iteration. Some of the features that can be found in the new model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model comes with a new robust encoder, OpenCLIP, created by LAION and aided by Stability AI; this version v2 significantly enhances the produced photos over the V1 versions. \n",
    "* The model can now generate images in a 768x768 resolution, offering more information to be shown in the generated images.\n",
    "* The model finetuned with [v-objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512). The v-parameterization is particularly useful for numerical stability throughout the diffusion process to enable progressive distillation for models. For models that operate at higher resolution, it is also discovered that the v-parameterization avoids color shifting artifacts that are known to affect high resolution diffusion models, and in the video setting it avoids temporal color shifting that sometimes appears with epsilon-prediction used in Stable Diffusion v1. \n",
    "* The model also comes with a new diffusion model capable of running upscaling on the images generated. Upscaled images can be adjusted up to 4 times the original image. Provided as separated model, for more details please check [stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler)\n",
    "* The model comes with a new refined depth architecture capable of preserving context from prior generation layers in an image-to-image setting. This structure preservation helps generate images that preserving forms and shadow of objects, but with different content.\n",
    "* The model comes with an updated inpainting module built upon the previous model. This text-guided inpainting makes switching out parts in the image easier than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to convert and run Stable Diffusion v2 model using OpenVINO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook contains the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create PyTorch models pipeline using Diffusers library.\n",
    "2. Convert PyTorch models to OpenVINO IR format, using model conversion API.\n",
    "3. Apply hybrid post-training quantization to UNet model with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/).\n",
    "4. Run Stable Diffusion v2 Text-to-Image pipeline with OpenVINO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is the full version of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image implementation. If you would like to get started and run the notebook quickly, check out [stable-diffusion-v2-text-to-image-demo notebook](../stable-diffusion-v2/stable-diffusion-v2-text-to-image-demo.ipynb).\n"

    "The stable diffusion model takes both a latent seed and a text prompt as input.

    "Next, the U-Net iteratively *denoises* the random latent image representations while being conditioned on the text embeddings. The output of the U-Net, being the noise residual, is used to compute a denoised latent image representation via a scheduler algorithm. Many different scheduler algorithms can be used for this computation, each having its pros and cons. For Stable Diffusion, it is recommended to use one of:\n",

    "Theory on how the scheduler algorithm function works is out of scope for this notebook, but in short, you should remember that they compute the predicted denoised image representation from the previous noise representation and the predicted noise residual.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Changed input resolution for U-Net model.\n",
    "* Changed text encoder and as the result size of its hidden state embeddings.\n",
    "* Additionally, to improve image generation quality authors introduced negative prompting. Technically, positive prompt steers the diffusion toward the images associated with it, while negative prompt steers the diffusion away from it.In other words, negative prompt declares undesired concepts for generation image, e.g. if we want to have colorful and bright image, gray scale image will be result which we want to avoid, in this case gray scale can be treated as negative prompt. The positive and negative prompt are in equal footing. You can always use one with or without the other. More explanation of how it works can be found in this [article](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-negative-prompt-work/). "
