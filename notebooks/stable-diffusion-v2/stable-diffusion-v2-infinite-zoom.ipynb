    "# Infinite Zoom Stable Diffusion v2 and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion v2 is the next generation of Stable Diffusion model a Text-to-Image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). \n",
    "\n",
    "General diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to denoise random gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an image.\n",
    "Diffusion models have shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for generating image data. But one downside of diffusion models is that the reverse denoising process is slow. In addition, these models consume a lot of memory because they operate in pixel space, which becomes unreasonably expensive when generating high-resolution images. Therefore, it is challenging to train these models and also use them for inference. OpenVINO brings capabilities to run model inference on Intel hardware and opens the door to the fantastic world of diffusion models for everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks, we already discussed how to run [Text-to-Image generation and Image-to-Image generation using Stable Diffusion v1](../stable-diffusion-text-to-image/stable-diffusion-text-to-image.ipynb) and [controlling its generation process using ControlNet](./controlnet-stable-diffusion/controlnet-stable-diffusion.ipynb). Now is turn of Stable Diffusion v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stable Diffusion v2: What’s new?\n",
    "\n",
    "The new stable diffusion model offers a bunch of new features inspired by the other models that have emerged since the introduction of the first iteration. Some of the features that can be found in the new model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model comes with a new robust encoder, OpenCLIP, created by LAION and aided by Stability AI; this version v2 significantly enhances the produced photos over the V1 versions. \n",
    "* The model can now generate images in a 768x768 resolution, offering more information to be shown in the generated images.\n",
    "* The model finetuned with [v-objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512). The v-parameterization is particularly useful for numerical stability throughout the diffusion process to enable progressive distillation for models. For models that operate at higher resolution, it is also discovered that the v-parameterization avoids color shifting artifacts that are known to affect high resolution diffusion models, and in the video setting it avoids temporal color shifting that sometimes appears with epsilon-prediction used in Stable Diffusion v1. \n",
    "* The model also comes with a new diffusion model capable of running upscaling on the images generated. Upscaled images can be adjusted up to 4 times the original image. Provided as separated model, for more details please check [stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler)\n",
    "* The model comes with a new refined depth architecture capable of preserving context from prior generation layers in an image-to-image setting. This structure preservation helps generate images that preserving forms and shadow of objects, but with different content.\n",
    "* The model comes with an updated inpainting module built upon the previous model. This text-guided inpainting makes switching out parts in the image easier than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to download the model from the Hugging Face Hub and converted to OpenVINO IR format with [Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion). And how to use the model to generate sequence of images for infinite zoom video effect.\n"

    "In this tutorial we consider how to use Stable Diffusion v2 model for generation sequence of images for infinite zoom video effect.\n",

    "In image editing, inpainting is a process of restoring missing parts of pictures. Most commonly applied to reconstructing old deteriorated images, removing cracks, scratches, dust spots, or red-eyes from photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with the power of AI and the Stable Diffusion model, inpainting can be used to achieve more than that. For example, instead of just restoring missing parts of an image, it can be used to render something entirely new in any part of an existing picture. Only your imagination limits it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow diagram explains how Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline for inpainting works:\n",
    "\n",
    "![sd2-inpainting](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/assets/22090501/9ac6de45-186f-4a3c-aa20-825825a337eb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline has a lot of common with Text-to-Image generation pipeline discussed in previous section. Additionally to text prompt, pipeline accepts input source image and mask which provides an area of image which should be modified. Masked image encoded by VAE encoder into latent diffusion space and concatenated with randomly generated (on initial step only) or produced by U-Net latent generated image representation and used as input for next step denoising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this inpainting feature, decreasing image by certain margin and masking this border for every new frame we can create interesting Zoom Out video based on our prompt."
