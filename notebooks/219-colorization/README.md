Colorization can turn a black and white image into a plausible color version of the image. Add color to black and white images, and bring the old images  back to life.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates colorization with OpenVINO using the [colorization-siggraph](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/colorization-siggraph) model from Open Model Zoo. The model was trained on  the ImageNet dataset with synthetically generated user interaction. Given a black and white image, the colorization model can turn it into a plausible color version of the image.
