    "# Text Prediction with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows text prediction with OpenVINO. We use three models [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), [GPT-Neo](https://zenodo.org/record/5297715#.ZAmpsXZBztU), and [PersonaGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12949v1), which are a part of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 and GPT-Neo are pre-trained on a large corpus of English text using unsupervised training. GPT-2 is available from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), \n",
    "GPT-Neo is also available from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M). They both display a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "PersonaGPT is an open-domain conversational agent that can decode  _personalized_ and _controlled_ responses based on user input. It is built on the pretrained [DialoGPT-medium](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT) model, following the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) architecture. \n",
    "PersonaGPT is fine-tuned on the [Persona-Chat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07243) dataset. The model is available from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/af1tang/personaGPT). PersonaGPT displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to take on personas, where we prime the model with few facts and have it generate based upon that, it can also be used for creating a chatbot on a knowledge base.\n",

    "For Text Generation, The model input is tokenized text, which serves as the initial condition for text generation. Then, logits from the models' inference results are obtained, and the token with the highest probability is selected using the top-k sampling strategy and joined to the input sequence. This procedure repeats until the end of the sequence token is received or the specified maximum length is reached. After that, tokenized IDs are decoded to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Conversation, User Input is tokenized with eos_token concatenated in the end. Then, the text gets generated as detailed above. The Generated response is added to the history with the eos_token at the end. Additional user input is added to the history, and the sequence is passed back into the model."

More information about transformers export to ONNX can be found in HuggingFace [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/serialization).\n",

The function returns instance of OpenVINO Model class, which is ready to use in Python interface but can also be serialized to OpenVINO IR format for future execution using `openvino.runtime.serialize`. In our case, `compress_to_fp16` parameter is enabled for compression model weights to fp16 precision and also specified dynamic input shapes with possible shape range (from 1 token to maximum length defined in our processing function) for optimization of memory consumption."
