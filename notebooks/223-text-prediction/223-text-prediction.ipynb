    "# Text Prediction with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows text prediction with OpenVINO. This notebook can work in two different modes, Text Generation and Conversation, which the user can select via selecting the model in the Model Selection Section. We use three models [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), [GPT-Neo](https://zenodo.org/record/5297715#.ZAmpsXZBztU), and [PersonaGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12949v1), which are a part of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family. GPT-2 and GPT-Neo can be used for text generation, whereas PersonaGPT is trained for the downstream task of conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 and GPT-Neo are pre-trained on a large corpus of English text using unsupervised training. They both display a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about the models are provided on their HuggingFace cards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)\n",
    "* [GPT-Neo](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M)\n",
    "\n",
    "PersonaGPT is an open-domain conversational agent that can decode  _personalized_ and _controlled_ responses based on user input. It is built on the pretrained [DialoGPT-medium](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT) model, following the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) architecture. \n",
    "PersonaGPT is fine-tuned on the [Persona-Chat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07243) dataset. The model is available from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/af1tang/personaGPT). PersonaGPT displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to take on personas, where we prime the model with few facts and have it generate based upon that, it can also be used for creating a chatbot on a knowledge base.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration in which the user can type the beginning of the text and the network will generate a further. This procedure can be repeated as many times as the user desires.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Text Generation, The model input is tokenized text, which serves as the initial condition for text generation. Then, logits from the models' inference results are obtained, and the token with the highest probability is selected using the top-k sampling strategy and joined to the input sequence. This procedure repeats until the end of the sequence token is received or the specified maximum length is reached. After that, tokenized IDs are decoded to text.\n",

    "\n",
    "For Conversation, User Input is tokenized with `eos_token` concatenated in the end. Then, the text gets generated as detailed above. The Generated response is added to the history with the `eos_token` at the end. Additional user input is added to the history, and the sequence is passed back into the model.\n",
