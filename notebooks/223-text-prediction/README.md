# Interactive Text Prediction with OpenVINO
Text generation is an area of natural language processing. It uses computational linguistics and artificial intelligence to automatically produce natural language texts that can meet specific communicative needs.
In this demo we have used <b> Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ([GPT-2](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/gpt-2)) </b> model for text prediction.

The complete pipeline of this demo's notebook is shown below.

This is an interactive demonstration in which the user can type text into the input bar and generate predicted text. This procedure can be repeated as many times as the user desires.
