# RAFT Optical Flow Estimation with OpenVINOâ„¢

This tutorial explains converting the RAFT ONNX\* model with OpenVNO and provides the image and video inference demo.

[Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) ](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) is a new deep network architecture for optical flow. 

Optical flow has applications in many video editing tasks, such as stabilization, compression, slow motion, etc. In addition,  some tracking and action recognition systems also use optical flow data.

FlowNet and RAFT are popular deep learning-based methods for motion estimation using optical flow. Compared to FlowNet, the first CNN method for calculating optical flow, RAFT is currently one of the most advanced methods.

RAFT extracts per-pixel features, builds multi-scale 4D correlation volumes for all pairs of pixels, and iteratively updates a flow field through a recurrent unit that performs lookups on the correlation volumes. RAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This tutorial demonstrates step-by-step instructions on how to run and optimize RAFT with OpenVINO based on the [ONNX-RAFT-Optical-Flow-Estimation](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/ONNX-RAFT-Optical-Flow-Estimation/tree/main).

The compressed model's size is 227M, containing pre-trained models for diverse datasets (SINTEL, KITTI, CHAIRS, etc.).
