This notebook demonstrates [Fast Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/style_transfer/fast_neural_style) on ONNX models with OpenVINO. Style Transfer models mix the content of an image with the style of another image.

This notebook uses five pre-trained models, for the following styles: Mosaic, Rain Princess, Candy, Udnie and Pointilism. The models are from the [ONNX Model Repository](https://github.com/onnx/models) and are based on the research paper [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi and Li Fei-Fei.


## Notebook Contents

This tutorial consists of the following steps:

- Loading an ONNX model in OpenVINO Runtime and doing inference on this model.
- Showing inference results on five neural style transfer models.
- Saving the transformed images and providing a download link.

The ONNX models and a sample image are provided in the notebook. For instructions on how to upload your own images to Jupyter Lab, see [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bd2QHqQSH4).

## Installation Instructions
