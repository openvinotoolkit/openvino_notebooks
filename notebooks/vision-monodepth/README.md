Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating scene depth using a single image. It has many potential applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging and autonomous systems. This demo uses a neural network model called MiDaS which was developed by the Intelligent Systems Lab at Intel. See their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341) to learn more.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates Monocular Depth Estimation with the [MidasNet model](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/midasnet/README.md) in OpenVINO.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
