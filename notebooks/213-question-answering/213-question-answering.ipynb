We use [small BERT-large-like model](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/intel/bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-int8-0002) distilled and quantized to INT8 on SQuAD v1.1 training set from larger BERT-large model. The model comes from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/). At the bottom of this notebook, you will see live inference results from your inputs."

    "The input size in this case is 384 tokens long. The main input (`input_ids`) to used BERT model consist of two parts: question tokens and context tokens separated by some special tokens. If question + context are shorter than 384 tokens, padding tokens are added. If question + context is longer than 384 tokens, the context must be split into parts and the question with different parts of context must be fed to the network many times. We use overlapping, so neighbor parts of the context are overlapped by half size of the context part (if the context part equals 300 tokens, neighbor context parts overlap with 150 tokens). We also need to provide: `attention_mask`, which is a sequence of integer values representing the mask of valid values in the input; `token_type_ids`, which is a sequence of integer values representing the segmentation of the `input_ids` into question and context; `position_ids`, which is a sequence of integer values from 0 to 383 representing the position index for each input token.

Usually, you need to wait a few seconds for the answer, but the longer context the longer the waiting time. The model is very limited and sensitive for the input. The answer can depend on whether there is a question mark at the end. The model will try to answer any of your questions even there is no good answer in the context, so in that case, you can see random results.\n",
