    "# Cross-lingual Books Alignment with Transformers and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-lingual text alignment is the task of matching sentences in a pair of texts that are translations of each other. In this notebook, you'll learn how to use a deep learning model to create a parallel book in English and German\n",
    "\n",
    "This method helps you learn languages but also provides parallel texts that can be used to train machine translation models. This is particularly useful if one of the languages is low-resource or you don't have enough data to train a full-fledged translation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook shows how to accelerate the most computationally expensive part of the pipeline - getting vectors from sentences - using the OpenVINO™ framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook guides you through the entire process of creating a parallel book: from obtaining raw texts to building a visualization of aligned sentences. Here is the pipeline diagram:\n",

    "There are several gaps in the resulting alignment, such as English sentence #14 not mapping to any German sentence. Here are some possible reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are no equivalent sentences in the other book, and in such cases, the model is working correctly.\n",
    "1. The sentence has an equivalent sentence in another language, but the model failed to identify it. The `threshold` might be too high, or the model is not sensitive enough. To address this, lower the `threshold` value or try a different model.\n",
    "1. The sentence has an equivalent text part in another language, meaning that either the sentence splitters are too fine or too coarse. Try tuning the text cleaning and splitting steps to fix this issue.\n",
    "1. Combination of 2 and 3, where both the model's sensitivity and text preparation steps need adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution to address this issue is by applying heuristics. As you can see, English sentence 13 corresponds to German 17, and 15 to 18. Most likely, English sentence 14 is part of either German sentence 17 or 18. By comparing the similarity using the model, you can choose the most suitable alignment.\n",

To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang, l mio tesor—not l mio tesor though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too,\" he remembered.</td><td id=\"list2-10\">Plötzlich aber sprang er empor, setzte sich aufrecht und öffnete die Augen.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-11\">Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.</td><td id=\"list2-11\">\"Ja, ja, wie war doch das?\" sann er, über seinem Traum grübelnd.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-12\">\"Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one’s thoughts awake.\"</td><td id=\"list2-12\">\"Wie war doch das?</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-13\">And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco.</td><td id=\"list2-13\">Richtig; Alabin gab ein Diner in Darmstadt; nein, nicht in Darmstadt, es war so etwas Amerikanisches dabei.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-14\">And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.</td><td id=\"list2-14\">Dieses Darmstadt war aber in Amerika, ja, und Alabin gab das Essen auf gläsernen Tischen, ja, und die Tische sangen: Il mio tesoro -- oder nicht so, es war etwas Besseres, und gewisse kleine Karaffen, wie Frauenzimmer aussehend,\" -- fiel ihm ein.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-15\">And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife’s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his brows.</td><td id=\"list2-15\">Die Augen Stefan Arkadjewitschs blitzten heiter, er sann und lächelte.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-16\">\"Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...\" he muttered, recalling everything that had happened.</td><td id=\"list2-16\">\"Ja, es war hübsch, sehr hübsch. Es gab viel Ausgezeichnetes dabei, was man mit Worten nicht schildern könnte und in Gedanken nicht ausdrücken.\"</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-17\">And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his own fault.</td><td id=\"list2-17\">Er bemerkte einen Lichtstreif, der sich von der Seite durch die baumwollenen Stores gestohlen hatte und schnellte lustig mit den Füßen vom Sofa, um mit ihnen die von seiner Gattin ihm im vorigen Jahr zum Geburtstag verehrten gold- und saffiangestickten Pantoffeln zu suchen; während er, einer alten neunjährigen Gewohnheit folgend, ohne aufzustehen mit der Hand nach der Stelle fuhr, wo in dem Schlafzimmer sonst sein Morgenrock zu hängen pflegte.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-18\">\"Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. And the most awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault, though I’m not to blame. That’s the point of the whole situation,\" he reflected.</td><td id=\"list2-18\">Hierbei erst kam er zur Besinnung; er entsann sich jäh wie es kam, daß er nicht im Schlafgemach seiner Gattin, sondern in dem Kabinett schlief; das Lächeln verschwand von seinen Zügen und er runzelte die Stirn.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-19\">\"Oh, oh, oh!\" he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.</td><td id=\"list2-19\">\"O, o, o, ach,\" brach er jammernd aus, indem ihm alles wieder einfiel, was vorgefallen war.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-20\">Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.</td><td id=\"list2-20\">Vor seinem Innern erstanden von neuem alle die Einzelheiten des Auftritts mit seiner Frau, erstand die ganze Mißlichkeit seiner Lage und -- was ihm am peinlichsten war -- seine eigene Schuld.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-21\">She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.</td><td id=\"list2-21\">\"Ja wohl, sie wird nicht verzeihen, sie kann nicht verzeihen, und am Schrecklichsten ist, daß die Schuld an allem nur ich selbst trage -- ich bin schuld -- aber nicht schuldig!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-22\">\"What’s this? this?\" she asked, pointing to the letter.</td><td id=\"list2-22\">Und hierin liegt das ganze Drama,\" dachte er, \"o weh, o weh!\"</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-23\">And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife’s words.</td><td id=\"list2-23\">Er sprach voller Verzweiflung, indem er sich alle die tiefen Eindrücke vergegenwärtigte, die er in jener Scene erhalten.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-24\">There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.</td><td id=\"list2-24\">Am unerquicklichsten war ihm jene erste Minute gewesen, da er, heiter und zufrieden aus dem Theater heimkehrend, eine ungeheure Birne für seine Frau in der Hand, diese weder im Salon noch im Kabinett fand, und sie endlich im Schlafzimmer antraf, jenen unglückseligen Brief, der alles entdeckte, in den Händen.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-25\">He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault.</td><td id=\"list2-25\">Sie, die er für die ewig sorgende, ewig sich mühende, allgegenwärtige Dolly gehalten, sie saß jetzt regungslos, den Brief in der Hand, mit dem Ausdruck des Entsetzens, der Verzweiflung und der Wut ihm entgegenblickend.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-26\">Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.</td><td id=\"list2-26\">\"Was ist das?\" frug sie ihn, auf das Schreiben weisend, und in der Erinnerung hieran quälte ihn, wie das oft zu geschehen pflegt, nicht sowohl der Vorfall selbst, als die Art, wie er ihr auf diese Worte geantwortet hatte.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-27\">This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself.</td><td id=\"list2-27\">Es ging ihm in diesem Augenblick, wie den meisten Menschen, wenn sie unerwartet eines zu schmählichen Vergehens überführt werden.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-28\">Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room.</td><td id=\"list2-28\">Er verstand nicht, sein Gesicht der Situation anzupassen, in welche er nach der Entdeckung seiner Schuld geraten war, und anstatt den Gekränkten zu spielen, sich zu verteidigen, sich zu rechtfertigen und um Verzeihung zu bitten oder wenigstens gleichmütig zu bleiben -- alles dies wäre noch besser gewesen als das, was er wirklich that -- verzogen sich seine Mienen (\"Gehirnreflexe\" dachte Stefan Arkadjewitsch, als Liebhaber von Physiologie) unwillkürlich und plötzlich zu seinem gewohnten, gutmütigen und daher ziemlich einfältigen Lächeln.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-29\">Since then she had refused to see her husband.</td><td id=\"list2-29\">Dieses dumme Lächeln konnte er sich selbst nicht vergeben.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-30\">\"It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,\" thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.</td><td id=\"list2-30\">Als Dolly es gewahrt hatte, erbebte sie, wie von einem physischen Schmerz, und erging sich dann mit der ihr eigenen Leidenschaftlichkeit in einem Strom bitterer Worte, worauf sie das Gemach verließ.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"list1-31\">\"But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?\" he said to himself in despair, and found no answer.</td><td id=\"list2-31\">Von dieser Zeit an wollte sie ihren Gatten nicht mehr sehen.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td id=\"list2-32\">\"An allem ist das dumme Lächeln schuld,\" dachte Stefan Arkadjewitsch.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td id=\"list2-33\">\"Aber was soll ich thun, was soll ich thun?\" frug er voll Verzweiflung sich selbst, ohne eine Antwort zu finden.</td></tr></table>\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can speed up the most computationally complex part of the pipeline - getting embeddings. You might wonder why, when using OpenVINO, you need to compile the model after reading it. There are two main reasons for this:\n",
    "1. Compatibility with different devices. The model can be compiled to run on a [specific device](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Working_with_devices.html), like CPU, GPU or GNA. Each device may work with different data types, support different features, and gain performance by changing the neural network for a specific computing model. With OpenVINO, you do not need to store multiple copies of the network with optimized for different hardware. A universal OpenVINO model representation is enough.\n",
    "1. Optimization for different scenarios. For example, one scenario prioritizes minimizing the _time between starting and finishing model inference_ ([**latency-oriented optimization**](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_deployment_optimization_guide_latency.html)). In our case, it is more important _how many texts per second the model can process_ ([**throughput-oriented optimization**](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_deployment_optimization_guide_tput.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a throughput-optimized model, pass a [performance hint](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Performance_Hints.html#performance-hints-latency-and-throughput) as a configuration during compilation. Then OpenVINO selects the optimal parameters for execution on the available hardware."
