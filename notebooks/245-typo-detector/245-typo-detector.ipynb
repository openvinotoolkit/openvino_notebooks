    "# Typo Detector with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Typo detection in AI is a process of identifying and correcting typographical errors in text data using machine learning algorithms. The goal of typo detection is to improve the accuracy, readability, and usability of text by identifying and indicating mistakes made during the writing process. To detect typos, AI-based typo detectors use various techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).\n",
    "\n",
    "A typo detector takes a sentence as an input and identify all typographical errors such as misspellings and homophone errors.\n",

    "This tutorial provides how to use the [Typo Detector](https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en) from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library in the OpenVINO environment to perform the above task.\n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides two methods to run the inference of typo detector with OpenVINO runtime, so that you can experience both calling the API of Optimum with OpenVINO Runtime included, and loading models in other frameworks, converting them to OpenVINO IR format, and running inference with OpenVINO Runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Using the [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) library\n",
    "The Hugging Face Optimum API is a high-level API that allows us to convert models from the Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINO™ IR format. Compiled models in OpenVINO IR format can be loaded using Optimum. Optimum allows the use of optimization on targeted hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Converting the model to ONNX and then to OpenVINO IR\n",
    "First the Pytorch model is converted to the ONNX format and then the [Model Optimizer](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) tool will be used to convert to [OpenVINO IR format](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_ir.html). This method provides much more insight to how to set up a pipeline from model loading to model converting, compiling and running inference with OpenVINO, so that you could conveniently use OpenVINO to optimize and accelerate inference for other deep-learning models. The optimization of targeted hardware is also used here.\n",
