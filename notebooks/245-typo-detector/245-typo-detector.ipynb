    "# Typo Detector with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "Typo detection in AI is a process of identifying and correcting typographical errors in text data using machine learning algorithms. The goal of typo detection is to improve the accuracy, readability, and usability of text by identifying and indicating mistakes made during the writing process. To detect typos, AI-based typo detectors use various techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL).\n",
