    "In the plots above, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, whereas validation accuracy stalls around 60% in the training process. Also, the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeable — a sign of [overfitting](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit).\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns from noises or unwanted details from training examples—to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. This phenomenon is known as overfitting. It means that the model will have a difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.\n",

    "There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. In this tutorial, you'll use *data augmentation* and add *Dropout* to your model."

    "Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training examples. [Data augmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation) takes the approach of generating additional training data from your existing examples by augmenting them using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.\n",
