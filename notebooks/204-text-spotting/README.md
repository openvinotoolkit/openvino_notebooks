This notebook shows how to recognize and detect text using OpenVINO Runtime.

## Notebook Contents

Text spotting in deep learning refers to the task of detecting and recognizing text in images or videos. It is a computer vision problem that has a wide range of applications, such as scene text recognition, document analysis, and optical character recognition (OCR).

In this notebook, we use the [Text Spotting Model](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/intel/text-spotting-0005) from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/). The model is built on top of the Mask-RCNN framework with additional attention-based text recognition head.
