    "# Person Tracking with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates live person tracking with OpenVINO: it reads frames from an input video sequence, detects people in the frames, uniquely identifies each one of them and tracks all of them until they leave the frame. We will use the [Deep SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402) algorithm to perform object tracking, an extension to SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detection vs Tracking\n",
    "- In object detection, we detect an object in a frame, put a bounding box or a mask around it, and classify the object. Note that, the job of the detector ends here. It processes each frame independently and identifies numerous objects in that particular frame. \n",
    "- An object tracker on the other hand needs to track a particular object across the entire video. If the detector detects three cars in the frame, the object tracker has to identify the three separate detections and needs to track it across the subsequent frames (with the help of a unique ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep SORT\n",
    "[Deep SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402) can be defined as the tracking algorithm which tracks objects not only based on the velocity and motion of the object but also the appearance of the object.\n",
    "It is made of three key components which are as follows:\n",
    "![deepsort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91237924/221744683-0042eff8-2c41-43b8-b3ad-b5929bafb60b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is the first step in the tracking module. In this step, a deep learning model will be used to detect the objects in the frame that are to be tracked. These detections are then passed on to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prediction**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this step, we use Kalman filter \\[1\\] framework to predict a target bounding box of each tracking object in the next frame. There are two states of prediction output: ```confirmed``` and ```unconfirmed```. A new track comes with a state of ```unconfirmed``` by default, and it can be turned into ```confirmed``` when a certain number of consecutive detections are matched with this new track. Meanwhile, if a matched track is missed over a specific time, it will be deleted as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data association and update**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Now, we have to match the target bounding box with the detected bounding box, and update track identities. A conventional way to solve the association between the predicted Kalman states and newly arrived measurements is to build an assignment problem with the Hungarian algorithm \\[2\\]. In this problem formulation, we integrate motion and appearance information through a combination of two appropriate metrics. The cost used for the first matching step is set as a combination of the Mahalanobis and the cosine distances. The [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is used to incorporate motion information and the cosine distance is used to calculate similarity between two objects. Cosine distance is a metric that helps the tracker recover identities in case of long-term occlusion and motion estimation also fails. For this purposes, a reidentification model will be implemented to produce a vector in high-dimensional space that represents the appearance of the object. Using these simple things can make the tracker even more powerful and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the second matching stage, we will run intersection over union(IOU) association as proposed in the original SORT algorithm \\[3\\] on the set of unconfirmed and unmatched tracks from the previous step. If the IOU of detection and target is less than a certain threshold value called `IOUmin` then that assignment is rejected. This helps to account for sudden appearance changes, for example, due to partial occlusion with static scene geometry, and to increase robustness against erroneous.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   When detection result is associated with a target, the detected bounding box is used to update the target state.\n",
