This notebook shows a person tracking scenario: it reads frames from an input video sequence, detects people in the frames, uniquely identifies each one of them and tracks all of them until they leave the frame.

## Notebook Contents

This tutorial uses the [Deep SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402) algorithm to perform object tracking.
[person detection model]( https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/omz_models_model_person_detection_0202.html) is deployed to detect the person in each frame of the video, and [reidentification model]( https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/omz_models_model_person_reidentification_retail_0287.html) is used to output embedding vector to match a pair of images of a person by the cosine distance.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
