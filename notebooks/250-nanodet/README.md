NanoDet is a FCOS-style one-stage anchor-free object detection model which using Generalized Focal Loss as classification and regression loss.

Real-time object detection is often used as a key component in computer vision systems. Applications that use real-time object detection models include video analytics, robotics, autonomous vehicles, multi-object tracking and object counting, medical image analysis, and many others.
