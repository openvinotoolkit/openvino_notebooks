Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating scene depth using a single image. It has many potential applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging and autonomous systems. For this demo, we use a neural network model called MiDaS which was developed by the Intelligent Systems Lab at Intel. Check out their research paper to learn more.
