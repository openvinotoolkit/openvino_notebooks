Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating scene depth using a single image. It has many potential applications in robotics, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging and autonomous systems. For this demo, we use a neural network model called MiDaS which was developed by the Intelligent Systems Lab at Intel. Check out their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341) to learn more.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates Monocular Depth Estimation with the [MidasNet model](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/midasnet/midasnet.md) in OpenVINO.
