    "OpenVINO [Intermediate Representation (IR)](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html) is the proprietary model format of OpenVINO. It is produced after converting a model with model conversion API. Model conversion API translates the frequently used deep learning operations to their respective similar representation in OpenVINO and tunes them with the associated weights and biases from the trained model. The resulting IR contains two files: an `.xml` file, containing information about network topology, and a `.bin` file, containing the weights and biases binary data."

You can choose one of them based on whichever is most convenient for you. There should not be any differences in the results of model conversion if the same set of parameters is used.
