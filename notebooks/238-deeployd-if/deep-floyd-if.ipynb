    "# Image generation with DeepFloyd IF and OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepFloyd IF is an advanced open-source text-to-image model that delivers remarkable photorealism and language comprehension. DeepFloyd IF consists of a frozen text encoder and three cascaded pixel diffusion modules: a base model that creates 64x64 pixel images based on text prompts and two super-resolution models, each designed to generate images with increasing resolution: 256x256 pixel and 1024x1024 pixel. All stages of the model employ a frozen text encoder, built on the T5 transformer, to derive text embeddings, which are then passed to a UNet architecture enhanced with cross-attention and attention pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text encoder impact\n",
    " - **Profound text prompt comprehension.**\n",
    "The generation pipeline leverages the T5-XXL-1.1 Large Language Model (LLM) as a text encoder. Its intelligence is backed by a substantial number of text-image cross-attention layers, this ensures superior alignment between the prompt and the generated image.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Realistic text in generated images.**\n",
    "Capitalizing on the capabilities of the T5 model, DeepFloyd IF produces readable text depictions alongside objects with distinct attributes, which have typically been a challenge for most existing text-to-image models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DeepFloyd IF Distinctive Features\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it is **Modular**.\n",
    "DeepFloyd IF pipeline is a consecutive inference of several neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which makes it **Cascaded**.\n",
    "The base model generates low-resolution samples, then super-resolution models upsample the images to produce high-resolution results.\n",
    "The models were individually trained at different resolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "DeepFloyd IF employs **Diffusion** models. Diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to denoise random Gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an image.\n",
    "Diffusion models have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for generating image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, DeepFloyd IF operates in **Pixel** space. Unlike latent diffusion models (Stable Diffusion for instance), the diffusion is implemented on a pixel level.\n",
    "\n",
    "![deepfloyd_if_scheme](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF/raw/develop/pics/deepfloyd_if_scheme.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph above depicts the three-stage generation pipeline:\n",
    "A text prompt is passed through the frozen T5-XXL LLM to convert it into a vector in embedded space. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stage 1: The first diffusion model in the cascade transforms the embedding vector into a 64x64 image. The DeepFloyd team has trained **three versions** of the base model, each with different parameters: IF-I 400M, IF-I 900M, and IF-I 4.3B. The smallest one is used by default, but users are free to change the checkpoint name to [\"DeepFloyd/IF-I-L-v1.0\"](https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/IF-I-L-v1.0) or [\"DeepFloyd/IF-I-XL-v1.0\"](https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/IF-I-XL-v1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stage 2: To upscale the image, two text-conditional super-resolution models (Efficient U-Net) are applied to the output of the first diffusion model. The first of these upscales the sample from 64x64 pixel to 256x256 pixel resolution. Again, several versions of this model are available: IF-II 400M (default) and IF-II 1.2B (checkpoint name \"DeepFloyd/IF-II-L-v1.0\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stage 3: Follows the same path as Stage 2 and upscales the image to 1024x1024 pixel resolution. It is not released yet, so we will use a conventional Super Resolution network to get hir-res results."
