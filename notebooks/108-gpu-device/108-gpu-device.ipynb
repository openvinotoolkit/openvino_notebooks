    "Originally, graphic processing units (GPUs) began as specialized chips, developed to accelerate the rendering of computer graphics. In contrast to CPUs, which have few but powerful cores, GPUs have many more specialized cores, making them ideal for workloads that can be parallelized into simpler tasks. Nowadays, one such workload is deep learning, where GPUs can easily accelerate inference of neural networks by splitting operations across multiple cores.\n",

    "OpenVINO supports inference on Intel integrated GPUs (which are included with most [Intel® Core™ desktop and mobile processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/core.html)) or on Intel discrete GPU products like the [Intel® Arc™ A-Series Graphics cards](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html) and [Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/data-center-gpu/flex-series.html). To get started, first [install OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_install_guides_overview.html) on a system equipped with one or more Intel GPUs. Follow the [GPU configuration instructions](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_for_intel_gpu.html) to configure OpenVINO to work with your GPU. Then, read on to learn how to accelerate inference with GPUs in OpenVINO!"

    "The latency and throughput hints mentioned above are great and can make a difference when used adequately but they usually use just one device, either due to the [AUTO plugin](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_AUTO.html#how-auto-works) or by manual specification of the device name as above. When we have multiple devices, such as an integrated and discrete GPU, we may use both at the same time to improve the utilization of the resources. In order to do this, OpenVINO provides a virtual device called [MULTI](https://docs.openvino.ai/nightly/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Running_on_multiple_devices.html), which is just a combination of the existent devices that knows how to split inference work between them, leveraging the capabilities of each device.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we want to use both integrated and discrete GPUs and the CPU at the same time, we can compile the model as follows:\n",

    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we always need to explicitly specify the device list for MULTI to work, otherwise MULTI does not know which devices are available for inference. However, this is not the only way to use multiple devices in OpenVINO. There is another performance hint called \"CUMULATIVE_THROUGHPUT\" that works similar to MULTI, except it uses the devices automatically selected by AUTO. This way, we do not need to manually specify devices to use. Below is an example showing how to use \"CUMULATIVE_THROUGHPUT\", equivalent to the MULTI one:\n",
