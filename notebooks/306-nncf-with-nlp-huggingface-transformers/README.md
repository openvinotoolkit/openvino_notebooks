This folder stores a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of integrating the NNCF (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf) into HuggingFace transformers repository (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) with the purpose of obtaining a quantized model using quantization-aware training. BERT-base and the task of text classification on the MRPC dataset are targeted specifically.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
To run this demo, a machine with at least one NVIDIA GPU on board is required.
### Run Jupyter notebook directly
Run the 306-nncf-with-nlp-huggingface-transformers.ipynb notebook in this folder using your Jupyter environment.

The system prerequisites of both OpenVINO (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) and NNCF (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf) must be installed.
