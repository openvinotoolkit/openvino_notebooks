Super Resolution is the process of enhancing the quality of an image by increasing the pixel count using deep learning.

## Notebook Contents

This tutorial is comprised of two notebooks. Both follow a similar concept of using a model called [Single Image Super Resolution (SISR)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/develop/models/intel/single-image-super-resolution-1032) which is available from the Open Model Zoo. It is based on this [research paper]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06779)).
