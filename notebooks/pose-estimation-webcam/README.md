Pose estimation predicts the 2D position and orientation of each person in an image or a video. Skeletons consisting of 18 predefined key points (joints) and 19 connections between them (limbs) are visualized as an overlay on the images or video.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates human pose estimation with OpenVINO, using the OpenPose [human-pose-estimation-0001](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/intel/human-pose-estimation-0001) model from Open Model Zoo.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
