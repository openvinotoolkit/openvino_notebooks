In this tutorial optical character recognition is presented. This notebook is a continuation of [hello-detection](../hello-detection) notebook.

## Notebook Contents

In addition to previously used [horizontal-text-detection-0001](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_horizontal_text_detection_0001.html) model, a[text-recognition-resnet](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_text_recognition_resnet_fc.html) model is used. This model reads tight aligned crop with detected text converted to a grayscale image and returns tensor that is easily decoded to predicted text. Both models are from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/).

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
