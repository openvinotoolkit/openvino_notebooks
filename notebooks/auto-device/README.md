This notebook shows how to do inference with Automatic Device Selection (AUTO). To learn more about the logic of this mode, refer to the [Automatic device selection](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/auto-device-selection.html) article.

## Notebook Contents

A basic introduction to use Auto Device Selection with OpenVINO.

This notebook demonstrates how to compile a model with AUTO device, compare the first inference latency (model compilation time + 1st inference time) between GPU device and AUTO device, show the difference in performance hints (THROUGHPUT and LATENCY) with significant performance results towards the desired metric.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
