# Image generation with Stable Diffusion v3 and OpenVINO

Stable Diffusion V3 is next generation of latent diffusion image Stable Diffusion models family that  outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image generation systems in typography and prompt adherence, based on human preference evaluations. In comparison with previous versions, it based on Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) text-to-image model that features greatly improved performance in image quality, typography, complex prompt understanding, and resource-efficiency.

More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium), [research paper](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-research-paper) and [Stability.AI blog post](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-medium).
In this tutorial, we will consider how to convert Stable Diffusion v3 for running with OpenVINO. An additional part demonstrates how to run optimization with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/) to speed up pipeline.
If you want to run previous Stable Diffusion versions, please check our other notebooks:

* [Stable Diffusion](../stable-diffusion-text-to-image)
* [Stable Diffusion v2](../stable-diffusion-v2)
* [Stable Diffusion XL](../stable-diffusion-xl)
* [LCM Stable Diffusion](../latent-consistency-models-image-generation)
* [Turbo SDXL](../sdxl-turbo)
* [Turbo SD](../sketch-to-image-pix2pix-turbo)


The notebook provides a simple interface that allows communication with a model using text instruction. In this demonstration user can provide input instructions and the model generates an image. An additional part demonstrates how to optimize model with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/) to speed up pipeline and reduce memory consumption.

The image below illustrates the provided generated image example.

>**Note**: Some demonstrated models can require at least 32GB RAM for conversion and running.

### Notebook Contents

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- Install prerequisites
- Collect Pytorch model pipeline
- Convert model to OpenVINO intermediate representation (IR) format and compress weights using NNCF
- Prepare OpenVINO Inference pipeline
- Run Text-to-Image generation
- Optimize pipeline with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/)
- Compare the results of the original and optimized pipelines
- Launch interactive demo

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
