    "# LLM-powered chatbot using Stable-Zephyr-3b and OpenVINO\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots have become powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations. \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant responses.\n",
    "While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic, one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions, LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable accuracy.\n",

    "`Stable Zephyr 3B` is a 3 billion parameter model that demonstrated outstanding results on many LLM evaluation benchmarks outperforming many popular models in relatively small size. Inspired by [HugginFaceH4's Zephyr 7B](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) training pipeline this model was trained on a mix of publicly available datasets, synthetic datasets using [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290), evaluation for this model based on [MT Bench](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/) and [Alpaca Benchmark](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/). More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to optimize and run this model using the OpenVINO toolkit. For the convenience of the conversion step and model performance evaluation, we will use [llm_bench](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/llm_bench/python) tool, which provides a unified approach to estimate performance for LLM. It is based on pipelines provided by Optimum-Intel and allows to estimate performance for Pytorch and OpenVINO models using almost the same code. We also demonstrate how to apply BetterTransformer optimization and making model stateful, that provides opportunity for processing model cache state."

    "## Convert model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) and compress model weights to INT4 using NNCF\n",
    "\n",
    "llm_bench provides conversion script for converting LLMS into OpenVINO IR format compatible with Optimum-Intel. It also allows to compress model weights into INT8 or INT4 precision with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf). For enabling weights compression in INT4 we should use `--compress_weights 4BIT_DEFAULT` argument. The Weights Compression algorithm is aimed at compressing the weights of the models and can be used to optimize the model footprint and performance of large models where the size of weights is relatively larger than the size of activations, for example, Large Language Models (LLM). Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more but introduces a minor drop in prediction quality. Additionally, it support way to optimize models using [BetterTransformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/bettertransformer) library, a fast path of standard PyTorch Transformer APIs to benefit from interesting speedups on CPU & GPU through sparsity and fused kernels as Flash Attention using `--bettertransformer` flag."

    "## Apply stateful transformation for automatic handling model state\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Zephyr is a decoder-only transformer model and generates text token by token in an autoregressive fashion. Since the output side is auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the same once computed for every further generation step. Therefore, recomputing it every time you want to generate a new token seems wasteful.  To optimize the generation process and use memory more efficiently, HuggingFace transformers API provides a mechanism for caching model state externally using `use_cache=True` parameter and `past_key_values` argument in inputs and outputs. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state once it has been computed. The model only computes the one for the most recently generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved ones for hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ for a transformer model. With this option, the model gets the previous step's hidden states (cached attention keys and values) as input and additionally provides hidden states for the current step as output. It means for all next iterations, it is enough to provide only a new token obtained from the previous step and cached key values to get the next token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "With increasing model size like in modern LLMs, we also can note an increase in the number of attention blocks and size past key values tensors respectively. The strategy for handling cache state as model inputs and outputs in the inference cycle may become a bottleneck for memory-bounded systems, especially with processing long input sequences, for example in a chatbot scenario. OpenVINO suggests a transformation that removes inputs and corresponding outputs with cache tensors from the model keeping cache handling logic inside the model. Hiding the cache enables storing and updating the cache values in a more device-friendly representation. It helps to reduce memory consumption and additionally optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can estimate the model performance by adding stateful transformation using `--make_stateful` flag."

    "  Consider the following example: The AI model has to complete the sentence \"The cat is ____.\" with the following token probabilities:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    playing: 0.5  \n",
    "    sleeping: 0.25  \n",
    "    eating: 0.15  \n",
    "    driving: 0.05  \n",
    "    flying: 0.05  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" or \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\"\n",
    "  * `Top-p`, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their cumulative probability. By adjusting the `top-p` value, you can influence the AI model's token selection, making it more focused or diverse.\n",
    "  Using the same example with the cat, consider the following top_p settings:  \n",
    "    - **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with the highest cumulative probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a higher cumulative probability, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" and \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens, including those with lower probabilities, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\" \n",
    "  * `Top-k` is an another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat, if k=3, then only \"playing\", \"sleeping\" and \"eating\" will be taken into account as possible next word.\n",
    "  * `Repetition Penalty` This parameter can help penalize tokens based on how frequently they occur in the text, including the input prompt. A token that has already appeared five times is penalized more heavily than a token that has appeared only one time. A value of 1 means that there is no penalty and values larger than 1 discourage repeated tokens.\n",
