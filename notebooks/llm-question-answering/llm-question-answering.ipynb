    "# LLM Instruction-following pipeline with OpenVINO \n",
    "\n",
    "LLM stands for “Large Language Model,” which refers to a type of artificial intelligence model that is designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. LLMs are trained on large datasets of text to learn patterns, grammar, and semantic relationships, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. One core capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to follow natural language instructions. Instruction-following models are capable of generating text in response to prompts and are often used for tasks like writing assistance, chatbots, and content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to run an instruction-following text generation pipeline using popular LLMs and OpenVINO. We will use pre-trained models from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. The [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library converts the models to OpenVINO™ IR format. To simplify the user experience, we will use [OpenVINO Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai) for generation of instruction-following inference pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install prerequisites\n",
    "- Download and convert the model from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).\n",
    "- Compress model weights to INT8 and INT4 with [OpenVINO NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf)\n",
    "- Create an instruction-following inference pipeline with [Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai)\n",

    "* **tiny-llama-1b-chat** - This is the chat model finetuned on top of [TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T). The TinyLlama project aims to pretrain a 1.1B Llama model on 3 trillion tokens with the adoption of the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2. This means TinyLlama can be plugged and played in many open-source projects built upon Llama. Besides, TinyLlama is compact with only 1.1B parameters. This compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint. More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0)\n",
    "* **phi-2** - Phi-2 is a Transformer with 2.7 billion parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as [Phi-1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5), augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts and filtered websites (for safety and educational value). When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-2 showcased a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters. More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2#limitations-of-phi-2).\n",
    "* **dolly-v2-3b** - Dolly 2.0 is an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine-learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. It is based on [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) and is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine-tuning records generated by Databricks employees in various capability domains, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization. Dolly 2.0 works by processing natural language instructions and generating responses that follow the given instructions. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including closed question-answering, summarization, and generation. More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-3b).\n",
    "* **red-pajama-3b-instruct** -  A 2.8B parameter pre-trained language model based on GPT-NEOX architecture. The model was fine-tuned for few-shot applications on the data of [GPT-JT](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/GPT-JT-6B-v1), with exclusion of tasks that overlap with the HELM core scenarios.More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Instruct-3B-v1).\n",
    "* **mistral-7b** - The Mistral-7B-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is a pretrained generative text model with 7 billion parameters. You can find more details about model in the [model card](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825) and [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/).\n",
    "* **llama-3-8b-instruct** - Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. More details about model can be found in [Meta blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/), [model website](https://llama.meta.com/llama3) and [model card](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct).\n",

You can find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\n",

    "After that we will configure parameters for decoding. We can get default config with `get_generation_config()`, setup parameters and apply the updated version with `set_generation_config(config)` or put config directly to `generate()`. It's also possible to specify the needed options just as inputs in the `generate()` method, as shown below.\n",

    "There are several parameters that can control text generation quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Temperature` is a parameter used to control the level of creativity in AI-generated text. By adjusting the `temperature`, you can influence the AI model's probability distribution, making the text more focused or diverse.  \n",
    "  Consider the following example: The AI model has to complete the sentence \"The cat is ____.\" with the following token probabilities:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    playing: 0.5  \n",
    "    sleeping: 0.25  \n",
    "    eating: 0.15  \n",
    "    driving: 0.05  \n",
    "    flying: 0.05  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" or \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\"\n",
    "  * `Top-p`, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their cumulative probability. By adjusting the `top-p` value, you can influence the AI model's token selection, making it more focused or diverse.\n",
    "  Using the same example with the cat, consider the following top_p settings:  \n",
    "    - **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with the highest cumulative probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a higher cumulative probability, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" and \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens, including those with lower probabilities, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\" \n",
    "  * `Top-k` is another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat, if k=3, then only \"playing\", \"sleeping\" and \"eating\" will be taken into account as possible next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation cycle repeats until the end of the sequence token is reached or it also can be interrupted when maximum tokens will be generated. As already mentioned before, we can enable printing current generated tokens without waiting until when the whole generation is finished using Streaming API, it adds a new token to the output queue and then prints them when they are ready."
