    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of a series on how to train, optimize, quantize and show live inference on a medical segmentation model. The goal is to accelerate inference on a kidney segmentation model. The [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) model is trained from scratch; the data is from [Kits19](https://github.com/neheller/kits19).\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook needs a quantized OpenVINO IR model. We provide a pretrained model trained for 20 epochs with the full [Kits-19](https://github.com/neheller/kits19) frames dataset, which has an F1 score on the validation set of 0.9. The training code is available in the [PyTorch Monai Training](../110-ct-segmentation-quantize/pytorch-monai-training.ipynb) notebook. It also needs images from the Kits19 dataset, converted to 2D images. For demonstration purposes, this tutorial will download one converted CT scan to use for inference."
