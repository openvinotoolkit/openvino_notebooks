    "This tutorial is part of a series on how to train, optimize, quantize and show live inference on a medical segmentation model. The goal is to accelerate inference on a kidney segmentation model. The [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) model is trained from scratch, and the data is from [Kits19](https://github.com/neheller/kits19).\n",

(To learn how the model is quantized, see the [Convert and Quantize a UNet Model and Show Live Inference](../110-ct-segmentation-quantize/110-ct-segmentation-quantize.ipynb) tutorial.)\n",
