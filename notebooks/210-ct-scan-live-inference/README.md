## What's Inside

This Jupyter notebook tutorial is part of a series that shows how to train,
optimize, quantize and show live inference on a segmentation model with PyTorch
Lightning and OpenVINO.

This is the final part that shows benchmarking results and live inference on
the quantized segmentation model. You will see real-time segmentation of kidney
CT scans running on a CPU, iGPU, or combining both devices for higher
throughput. The processed frames are 3D scans that are shown as individual
slices. The visualization slides through the slices with detected kidneys
overlayed in red.  We provide a pre-trained and quantized model, so running the
previous tutorials in the series is not required.

## Installation Instructions

For a minimum installation:

* Create a virtual environment, with `python -m venv openvino_env` (on Linux
  you may need to type `python3`) and activate it with
  `openvino_env\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source
  openvino_env/bin/activate` on macOS or Linux.
* Clone the openvino_notebooks repository: `git clone
  https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/`
* Change to the directory: `cd openvino_notebooks`
* Check out the live_inference branch `git checkout live_inference`
* Change to the notebook directory: `cd notebooks/210-ct-scan-live-inference`
* Install the requirements with `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run the notebook by typing `jupyter lab` and doubleclicking on the notebook from the left sidebar.

> NOTE: This notebook needs an internet connection to download data. If you use a proxy server, please enable the proxy server in the terminal before typing `jupyter lab`.

> NOTE: To use the other notebooks in the openvino_notebooks repository, please follow the instructions in the main README at https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/
