# OpenVINO™ Explainable AI Toolkit: Basic notebook

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/explainable-ai-1-basic/explainable-ai-1-basic.ipynb)

This is the **first notebook** in series of exploring [OpenVINO™ Explainable AI (XAI)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/).

It will show the first steps in the XAI toolkit, covering the following topics:

* Explanation of [XAI](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/) toolkit and concept of saliency maps.
* How to create saliency map for OpenVINO™ IR models using [XAI](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/).

## Saliency Map

A saliency map is a visualization technique that highlights regions of the interest in an image from the model perspective. For example, it can be used to explain classification model predictions for a particular label. Here is an example of a saliency map that you will get in this notebook:

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
