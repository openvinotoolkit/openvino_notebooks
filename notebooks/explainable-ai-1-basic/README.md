# eXplainable AI (XAI) for OpenVINO™ IR Models

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/explainable-ai-1-basic/explainable-ai-1-basic.ipynb)

The notebook will cover the following topics:

* Explanation of [OpenVINO™ Explainable AI (XAI)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/) and saliency maps.
* How to create saliency map for OpenVINO™ IR models using [OpenVINO™ Explainable AI (XAI)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/).

## Saliency Map

A saliency map is a visualization technique that highlights regions of the interest in an image from the model perspective. For example, it can be used to explain classification model predictions for a particular label. Here is an example of a saliency map that you will get in this notebook:
