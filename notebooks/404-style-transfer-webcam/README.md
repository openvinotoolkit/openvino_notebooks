# Live Style Transfer with OpenVINOâ„¢

Artistic style transfer blends a single style to any given content image. The real-time style transfer is able to train a neural network to apply a single style to any given content image. Given this ability, a different network could be trained for each different style we wish to apply.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates style transfer with OpenVINO, using the [Fast Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/style_transfer/fast_neural_style) model from [ONNX Model Repository](https://github.com/onnx/models).
The idea is to use feed-forward convolutional neural networks to generate image transformations. The networks are trained using perceptual loss functions and effectively apply style transfer on a image / video.
