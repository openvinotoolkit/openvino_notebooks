# Live Style Transfer with OpenVINOâ„¢

![style transfer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109281183/204767232-95b8f0a8-010e-4f6d-981e-104200652098.jpg)

Artistic style transfer blends a single style to any given content image. The real-time style transfer is able to train a neural network to apply a single style to any given content image. Given this ability, a different network could be trained for each different style we wish to apply.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates style transfer with OpenVINO, using the [Fast Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/style_transfer/fast_neural_style) model from [ONNX Model Repository](https://github.com/onnx/models).
The idea is to use feed-forward convolutional neural networks to generate image transformations. The networks are trained using [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) along with [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022) and effectively apply style transfer on a image / video.

## Installation Instructions

If you have not installed all required dependencies, follow the [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
