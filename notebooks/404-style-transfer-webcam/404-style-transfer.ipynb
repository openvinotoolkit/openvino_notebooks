    "# Style Transfer with OpenVINOâ„¢\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates style transfer with OpenVINO, using the [Style Transfer Models](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/fast-neural-style-mosaic-onnx) from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/), specifically [fast-neural-style-mosaic-onnx](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/fast-neural-style-mosaic-onnx) model is one of the style transfer models designed to mix the content of an image with the style of another image. The model uses the method described in [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) along with [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022). Original ONNX models are provided in the [repository](https://github.com/onnx/models). Final part of this notebook shows live inference results from a webcam. Additionally, you can also upload a video file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: To use this notebook with a webcam, you need to run the notebook on a computer with a webcam. If you run the notebook on a server, the webcam will not work. However, you can still do inference on a video."
