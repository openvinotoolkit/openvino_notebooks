The mo.py script performs optimizations such as weight quantization and layout transformations to improve model performance on Intel hardware. Once the ONNX model has been converted to IR format, it can be executed on a range of Intel devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and VPUs, using the OpenVINO inference engine.
