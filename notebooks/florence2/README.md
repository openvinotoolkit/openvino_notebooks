# Florence-2: Open Source Vision Foundation Model

Florence-2 is a lightweight vision-language foundation model developed by Microsoft Azure AI and open-sourced under the MIT license. It aims to achieve a unified, prompt-based representation for diverse vision and vision-language tasks, including captioning, object detection, grounding, and segmentation. Despite its compact size, Florence-2 rivals much larger models like [Kosmos-2](../kosmos2-multimodal-large-language-model/kosmos2-multimodal-large-language-model.ipynb) in performance. Florence-2 represents a significant advancement in vision-language models by combining lightweight architecture with robust capabilities, making it highly accessible and versatile. Its unified representation approach, supported by the extensive FLD-5B dataset, enables it to excel in multiple vision tasks without the need for separate models. This efficiency makes Florence-2 a strong contender for real-world applications, particularly on devices with limited resources.

In this tutorial we consider how to convert and run Florence2 using OpenVINO.

## Notebook contents
The tutorial consists from following steps:

- Install requirements
- Convert model
- Run OpenVINO model inference
- Launch Interactive demo

In this demonstration, you'll try to run model on various vision tasks including object detection, image captioning and text recognition.

## Installation instructions
This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
