Image in-painting is the task of filling missing pixels of an image.
This notebook uses a generative multi-column convolution neural network (GMCNN) model for this purpose.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook provides a tutorial on how to use image in-painting with OpenVINO. The model used in this notebook is [GMCNN-places2-tf](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_gmcnn_places2_tf.html)

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
