    "# Convert and Optimize Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "The last decade has seen an exponential growth in video data. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/), the number of video content hours uploaded every minute on YouTube grew by ~40% between 2014 and 2020. As of June 2022, more than 500 hours of video were uploaded to YouTube every minute. One of the most important tasks that the YouTube platform engages in is the efficient (and automatic) removal of harmful content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This requires the accurate detection and recognition of actions, events, and/or context in the videos. This task is called *video understanding* and is one of the grand challenges in the field of Computer Vision as the temporal order of actions is crucial for accurate classification. For example, an algorithm should be able to differentiate between the action of opening and closing a door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lin et al. (2019) proposed the [Temporal Shift Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08383) (TSM) for efficient video understanding. The module allows for joint spatial-temporal modeling by shifting part of the channels along the temporal dimension to exchange information with neighboring frames. The TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance, at the level of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but at the lower computational cost of 2D CNNs. For more details of the TSM model, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08383) and [repository](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/temporal-shift-module).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to run and optimize the PyTorch TSM model with OpenVINO.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "- Prepare and load PyTorch TSM model\n",
    "- Convert PyTorch model to ONNX\n",
    "- Convert ONNX model to OpenVINO IR\n",
    "- Download and prepare dataset\n",
    "- Compare accuracy of PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenVINO IR models\n",
    "- Optimize the OpenVINO IR model using post-training 8-bit integer quantization\n",
    "- Compare accuracy and performance of the FP32 and quantized models.\n"
