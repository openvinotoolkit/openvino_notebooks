## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates object detection with OpenVINO, using the [SSDLite MobileNetV2](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/public/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2) model from Open Model Zoo. The model was trained on [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
