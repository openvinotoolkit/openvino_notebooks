# Introduction to Performance Tricks in OpenVINO™

These notebooks show tips on how to optimize inference in OpenVINO™.   

There are different performance targets for various use case scenarios. For example, video conferencing usually requires the latency to be as short as possible. While for high-resolution video/image analysis, high throughput is typically the performance target. As a result, different optimization tricks should be applied to achieve other performance targets.
In this notebook, we’ll show a set of performance tricks for optimizing inferencing latency.
