[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/216-attention-center/216-attention-center.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how the use [attention center model](https://github.com/google/attention-center/tree/main) with OpenVINO. This model is in the [TensorFlow Lite format](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), which is supported in OpenVINO now by TFLite frontend. Check out [this article](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/12/open-sourcing-attention-center-model.html) to find more information about this model. The attention-center model takes an RGB image as input and return a 2D point as result, which is the predicted center of human attention on the image.
