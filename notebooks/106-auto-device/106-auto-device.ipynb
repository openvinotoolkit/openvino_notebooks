    "# Automatic Device Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The Auto Device (or AUTO in short) selects the most suitable device from the available compute devices by considering the network precision, power efficiency and processing capability. The network precision (if the network is quantized or not) is the first consideration to filter out the devices that cannot run the network efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the dedicated accelerator devices are preferred, e.g., discrete GPU, integrated GPU, or VPU. CPU is used as the default “fallback device”. Please note that AUTO does this selection only once at the network load time. \n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing the accelerator device like GPUs, loading the network to these devices may take long time. To address this challenge for application that requires fast initial inference response the AUTO starts inferencing immediately on the CPU and then transparently shifts inferencing to the GPU once ready, dramatically reducing time to first inference.\n",

Originally redistributed in Saved model format, converted to frozen graph using tf.graph_util module.

    "## First inference latency benifit with AUTO\n",
    "One of the key performance benefits of AUTO is on first inference latency (FIL = compile model time + fist inference execution time). Directly using CPU device would produce the shortest first inference latency as the OpenVINO graph representations can really quickly be JIT-compiled to CPU. The challenge is with the GPU. Since the OpenCL complication of graph to GPU-optimized kernels takes a few seconds to complete for this platform. If AUTO selects GPU as the device, this initialization time may be intolerable to some applications, which is the reason for AUTO to transparently use the CPU as the first inference device until GPU is ready. \n",

    "The next highlight is the differentiation of performance hint with AUTO. By specifying LATENCY hint or THROUGHTPUT hint, AUTO demonstrate significant performance results towards the desired metric. THROUGHTPUT hint delivers much higher frame per second (FPS) performance than LATENCY hint. In contrast, the LATENCY hint delivers much lower latency than THROUGHTPUT hint. Notice that the hints do not require low-level device-specific settings, and are also completely portable between the devices, which allows the AUTO just to expedite the hint value directly to the selected device.\n",
