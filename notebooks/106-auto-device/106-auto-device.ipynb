    "# Automatic Device Selection with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Auto device](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_AUTO.html) (or AUTO in short) selects the most suitable device for inference by considering the model precision, power efficiency and processing capability of the available [compute devices](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html). The model precision (such as `FP32`, `FP16`, `INT8`, etc.) is the first consideration to filter out the devices that cannot run the network efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if dedicated accelerators are available, these devices are preferred (for example, integrated and discrete [GPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_GPU.html#doxid-openvino-docs-o-v-u-g-supported-plugins-g-p-u) or [VPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_VPU.html)). [CPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_CPU.html) is used as the default \"fallback device\". Keep in mind that AUTO makes this selection only once, during the loading of a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using accelerator devices such as GPUs, loading models to these devices may take a long time. To address this challenge for applications that require fast first inference response, AUTO starts inference immediately on the CPU and then transparently shifts inference to the GPU, once it is ready. This dramatically reduces the time to execute first inference.\n",

Using the CPU device explicitly will produce the shortest first inference latency, as the OpenVINO graph representation loads quickly on CPU, using just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The challenge is with GPU devices since OpenCL graph complication to GPU-optimized kernels takes a few seconds to complete. This initialization time may be intolerable for some applications.
