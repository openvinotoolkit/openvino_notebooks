    "# Create an LLM-powered Chatbot using OpenVINO\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations. \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant responses.\n",
    "While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic, one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions, LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we already discussed how to build an instruction-following pipeline using OpenVINO and Optimum Intel, please check out [Dolly example](../dolly-2-instruction-following) for reference.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to use the power of OpenVINO for running Large Language Models for chat. We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. The [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library converts the models to OpenVINO™ IR format. To simplify the user experience, we will use [OpenVINO Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai) for generation of instruction-following inference pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install prerequisites\n",
    "- Download and convert the model from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).\n",
    "- Compress model weights to 4-bit or 8-bit data types using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf)\n",
    "- Create a chat inference pipeline with [OpenVINO Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/src/README.md).\n",
    "- Run chat pipeline\n",

    "The [Weights Compression](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html) algorithm is aimed at compressing the weights of the models and can be used to optimize the model footprint and performance of large models where the size of weights is relatively larger than the size of activations, for example, Large Language Models (LLM). Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in prediction quality.\n",

    "You can also apply fp16, 8-bit or 4-bit weight compression on the Linear, Convolutional and Embedding layers when exporting your model with the CLI by setting `--weight-format` to respectively fp16, int8 or int4. This type of optimization allows to reduce the memory footprint and inference latency.\n",
    "By default the quantization scheme for int8/int4 will be [asymmetric](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#asymmetric-quantization), to make it [symmetric](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#symmetric-quantization) you can add `--sym`.\n",

We can get default config with `get_generation_config()`, setup parameters and apply the updated version with `set_generation_config(config)` or put config directly to `generate()`. It's also possible to specify the needed options just as inputs in the `generate()` method, as shown below.\n",

On the first iteration, it is provided instructions joined to conversation history (if exists) converted to token ids using a tokenizer, then prepared input provided to the model. The model generates probabilities for all tokens in logits format. The way the next token will be selected over predicted probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology. You can find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). The result generation updates conversation history for next conversation step. It makes stronger connection of next question with previously provided and allows user to make clarifications regarding previously provided answers.

    "There are several parameters that can control text generation quality: \n",
    "  * `Temperature` is a parameter used to control the level of creativity in AI-generated text. By adjusting the `temperature`, you can influence the AI model's probability distribution, making the text more focused or diverse.  \n",
    "  Consider the following example: The AI model has to complete the sentence \"The cat is ____.\" with the following token probabilities:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    playing: 0.5  \n",
    "    sleeping: 0.25  \n",
    "    eating: 0.15  \n",
    "    driving: 0.05  \n",
    "    flying: 0.05  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" or \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\"\n",
    "  * `Top-p`, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their cumulative probability. By adjusting the `top-p` value, you can influence the AI model's token selection, making it more focused or diverse.\n",
    "  Using the same example with the cat, consider the following top_p settings:  \n",
    "    - **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with the highest cumulative probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a higher cumulative probability, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" and \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens, including those with lower probabilities, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\" \n",
    "  * `Top-k` is an another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat, if k=3, then only \"playing\", \"sleeping\" and \"eating\" will be taken into account as possible next word.\n",
    "  * `Repetition Penalty` This parameter can help penalize tokens based on how frequently they occur in the text, including the input prompt. A token that has already appeared five times is penalized more heavily than a token that has appeared only one time. A value of 1 means that there is no penalty and values larger than 1 discourage repeated tokens.https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide.html"
