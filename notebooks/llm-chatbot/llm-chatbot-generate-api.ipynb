    "# Create an LLM-powered Chatbot using OpenVINO Generate API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations. \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant responses.\n",
    "While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic, one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions, LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we already discussed how to build an instruction-following pipeline using OpenVINO, please check out [this tutorial](../llm-question-answering/llm-question-answering.ipynb) for reference.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to use the power of OpenVINO for running Large Language Models for chat. We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. The [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library converts the models to OpenVINO™ IR format. To simplify the user experience, we will use [OpenVINO Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai) for generation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install prerequisites\n",
    "- Download and convert the model from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).\n",
    "- Compress model weights to 4-bit or 8-bit data types using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf)\n",
    "- Create a chat inference pipeline with [OpenVINO Generate API](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/src/README.md).\n",
    "- Run chat pipeline with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).\n",

    "[Weight compression](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html) is a technique for enhancing the efficiency of models, especially those with large memory requirements. This method reduces the model’s memory footprint, a crucial factor for Large Language Models (LLMs). We provide several options for model weight compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FP16** reducing model binary size on disk using `save_model` with enabled compression weights to FP16 precision. This approach is available in OpenVINO from scratch and is the default behavior.\n",
    "* **INT8** is an 8-bit weight-only quantization provided by [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf): This method compresses weights to an 8-bit integer data type, which balances model size reduction and accuracy, making it a versatile option for a broad range of applications.\n",
    "* **INT4** is an 4-bit weight-only quantization provided by [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf). involves quantizing weights to an unsigned 4-bit integer symmetrically around a fixed zero point of eight (i.e., the midpoint between zero and 15). in case of **symmetric quantization** or asymmetrically with a non-fixed zero point, in case of **asymmetric quantization** respectively. Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in prediction quality. INT4 it ideal for situations where speed is prioritized over an acceptable trade-off against accuracy.\n",
    "* **INT4 AWQ** is an 4-bit activation-aware weight quantization. [Activation-aware Weight Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) (AWQ) is an algorithm that tunes model weights for more accurate INT4 compression. It slightly improves generation quality of compressed LLMs, but requires significant additional time for tuning weights on a calibration dataset. We will use `wikitext-2-raw-v1/train` subset of the [Wikitext](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/wikitext) dataset for calibration.\n",

You can find more detailed info about  tokenization theory and OpenVINO Tokenizers in this [tutorial](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/openvino-tokenizers/openvino-tokenizers.ipynb). Then tokenized input passed to LLM for making prediction of next token probability. The way the next token will be selected over predicted probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology.  You can find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). The sampler's goal is to select the next token id is driven by generation configuration. Next, we apply stop generation condition to check the generation is finished or not (e.g. if we reached the maximum new generated tokens or the next token id equals to end of the generation).  If the end of the generation is not reached, then new generated token id is used as the next iteration input, and the generation cycle repeats until the condition is not met. When stop generation criteria are met, then OpenVINO Detokenizer decodes generated token ids to text answer. \n",

To keep conversational history, we should move LLMPipeline to chat mode using `start_chat()` method.\n",

    "    - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" or \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\"\n",
    "  * `Top-p`, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their cumulative probability. By adjusting the `top-p` value, you can influence the AI model's token selection, making it more focused or diverse.\n",
    "  Using the same example with the cat, consider the following top_p settings:  \n",
    "    - **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with the highest cumulative probability, such as \"playing.\"  \n",
    "    - **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a higher cumulative probability, such as \"playing,\" \"sleeping,\" and \"eating.\"  \n",
    "    - **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens, including those with lower probabilities, such as \"driving\" and \"flying.\" \n",
    "  * `Top-k` is an another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat, if k=3, then only \"playing\", \"sleeping\" and \"eating\" will be taken into account as possible next word.\n",
    "  * `Repetition Penalty` This parameter can help penalize tokens based on how frequently they occur in the text, including the input prompt. A token that has already appeared five times is penalized more heavily than a token that has appeared only one time. A value of 1 means that there is no penalty and values larger than 1 discourage repeated tokens.\n",
