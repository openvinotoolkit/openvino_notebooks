Question answering is a part of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is able to answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. Question answering systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents called, in that case, a knowledge base.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates question answering with OpenVINO by using the [Squad-tuned BERT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/models/intel/bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-int8-0002) model from Open Model Zoo.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
