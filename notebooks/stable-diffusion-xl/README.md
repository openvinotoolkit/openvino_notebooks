# Image generation with Stable Diffusion XL and OpenVINO

## Stable Diffusion XL

Stable Diffusion XL or SDXL is the latest image generation model that is tailored towards more photorealistic outputs with more detailed imagery and composition compared to previous Stable Diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion 2.1.

With Stable Diffusion XL you can now make more realistic images with improved face generation, produce legible text within images, and create more aesthetically pleasing art using shorter prompts.

[SDXL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952) consists of an [ensemble of experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01324) pipeline for latent diffusion: In the first step, the base model is used to generate (noisy) latents, which are then further processed with a refinement model specialized for the final denoising steps. Note that the base model can be used as a standalone module or in a two-stage pipeline as follows: First, the base model is used to generate latents of the desired output size. In the second step, we use a specialized high-resolution model and apply a technique called [SDEdit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073)( also known as "image to image") to the latents generated in the first step, using the same prompt. 

Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone: The increase of model parameters is mainly due to more attention blocks and a larger cross-attention context as SDXL uses a second text encoder. The authors design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios and also introduce a refinement model that is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. The testing of SDXL shows drastically improved performance compared to the previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators.

In this tutorial, we consider how to run the SDXL model using OpenVINO.

We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format.

The notebook provides a simple interface that allows communication with a model using text instruction. In this demonstration user can provide input instructions and the model generates an image.

The image below illustrates the provided user instruction and generated image example.

>**Note**: Some demonstrated models can require at least 64GB RAM for conversion and running.

## Segmind-VegaRT

The [Segmind Vega](https://huggingface.co/segmind/Segmind-Vega) Model is a distilled version of the [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0), offering a remarkable 70% reduction in size and an impressive speedup while retaining high-quality text-to-image generation capabilities. Segmind Vega marks a significant milestone in the realm of text-to-image models, setting new standards for efficiency and speed. Engineered with a compact yet powerful design, it boasts only 745 million parameters. This streamlined architecture not only makes it the smallest in its class but also ensures lightning-fast performance, surpassing the capabilities of its predecessors. Vega represents a breakthrough in model optimization. Its compact size, compared to the 859 million parameters of the SD 1.5 and the hefty 2.6 billion parameters of SDXL, maintains a commendable balance between size and performance. Vega's ability to deliver high-quality images rapidly makes it a game-changer in the field, offering an unparalleled blend of speed, efficiency, and precision.

Segmind Vega is a symmetrical, distilled version of the SDXL model; it is over 70% smaller and ~100% faster. The Down Block contains 247 million parameters, the Mid Block has 31 million, and the Up Block has 460 million. Apart from the size difference, the architecture is virtually identical to that of SDXL, ensuring compatibility with existing interfaces requiring no or minimal adjustments. Although smaller than the SD1.5 Model, Vega supports higher-resolution generation due to the SDXL architecture, making it an ideal replacement for [Stable Diffusion 1.5](https://huggingface.co/botp/stable-diffusion-v1-5)

Segmind VegaRT is a distilled LCM-LoRA adapter for the Vega model, that allowed us to reduce the number of inference steps required to generate a good quality image to somewhere between 2 - 8 steps. . Latent Consistency Model (LCM) LoRA was proposed in [LCM-LoRA: A universal Stable-Diffusion Acceleration Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05556) by Simian Luo, Yiqin Tan, Suraj Patil, Daniel Gu et al.

More details about models can be found in [Segmind blog post](https://blog.segmind.com/segmind-vega/)

In this tutorial, we explore how to run and optimize Segmind-VegaRT with OpenVINO. We will use a pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format. Additionally, we demonstrate how to improve pipeline latency with the quantization UNet model using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf).

The notebook provides a simple interface that allows communication with a model using text instruction. In this demonstration user can provide input instructions and the model generates an image.
