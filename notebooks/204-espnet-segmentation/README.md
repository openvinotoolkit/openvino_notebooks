This notebook conrtains a full guide on how to use ESPNet-C version in Pytorch format, convert ESPNet to ONNX and OpenVINO IR format and run inference on them.


## Notebook Content

- Prerequisites
- Import necessary packages
- Load ESPNEt-C model and test inference on it
- Convert PyTorch model to ONNX
- Convert ONNX model to OpenVINO IR
- Run inference on ONNX and OpenVINO IR models and display inference runtime
- Visualize results from 3 models for comaprison


## Installation Instructions

If you have not installed all required dependencies, follow the [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
