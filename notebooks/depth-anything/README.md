DepthAnything is a highly practical solution for robust monocular depth estimation. Without pursuing novel technical modules, this project aims to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing with any images under any circumstances.
The framework of Depth Anything is shown below. it adopts a standard pipeline to unleashing the power of large-scale unlabeled images.

There are two version of DepthAnything models. The notebooks series include the demonstration of work [Depth Anything V1](https://depth-anything.github.io/) and [Depth Anything V2](https://depth-anything.github.io/). Depth Anything V2 significantly outperforms V1 in fine-grained details and robustness.

In these tutorials we will explore how to convert and run DepthAnything using OpenVINO. An additional part demonstrates how to run quantization with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/) to speed up the model.

## Notebook Contents

Both tutorials consists of following steps:
- Install prerequisites
- Load and run PyTorch model inference
- Convert Model to Openvino Intermediate Representation format
- Run OpenVINO model inference on single image
- Run OpenVINO model inference on video
- Optimize Model
- Compare results of original and optimized models
- Launch interactive demo

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
