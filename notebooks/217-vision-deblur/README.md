Deblurring is the task of removing motion blurs that usually occur in photos shot with hand-held cameras, when there are moving objects in the scene. Blurs not only reduce the human perception about the quality of the image, but also complicate computer vision analyses.

## Notebook Contents

This tutorial demonstrates Single Image Motion Deblurring with DeblurGAN-v2 in OpenVINO, by first converting the [VITA-Group/DeblurGANv2](https://github.com/VITA-Group/DeblurGANv2) model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (OpenVINO IR) format. For more information about the model, see the [deblurgan-v2 model documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/omz_models_model_deblurgan_v2.html).

### The Data

The image above is a sample of the test subset of the [GOPRO](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/gopro) dataset. This dataset is one of the three that were used to train DeblurGAN-v2, and contains pairs of blurred and sharp images.
