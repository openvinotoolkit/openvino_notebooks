# Grammatical Error Correction with OpenVINO


Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different types of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical and word choice errors. 
GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and is expected to transform it into a more correct version. See the example given below:

| Input (Erroneous)                                         | Output (Corrected)                                       |

This tutorial shows how to perform grammatical error correction using OpenVINO. We will use pre-trained models from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format.

## Notebook Contents

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- Install prerequisites
- Download and convert models from a public source using the [OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino).
- Create an inference pipeline for grammatical error checking

As the result, will be created inference pipeline which accepts text with grammatical errors and provides text with corrections as output.

The result of work represneted in the table below

| Input Text                                                | Output (Corrected)                                       |
