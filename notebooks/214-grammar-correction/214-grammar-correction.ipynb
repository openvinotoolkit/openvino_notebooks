    "# Grammatical Error Correction with OpenVINO\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-based auto-correction products are becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use, editing speed, and affordability. These products improve the quality of written text in emails, blogs, and chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different types of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical and word choice errors.\n",
    "GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and is expected to transform it into a more correct version. See the example given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input (Erroneous)                                         | Output (Corrected)                                       |\n",

    "This tutorial shows how to perform grammatical error correction using OpenVINO. We will use pre-trained models from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library. To simplify the user experience, the [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) library is used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format.\n",

    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Grammatical Error Correction task can be thought of as a sequence-to-sequence task where a model is trained to take a grammatically incorrect sentence as input and return a grammatically correct sentence as output. We will use the [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis) model finetuned on an expanded version of the [JFLEG](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jfleg) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of FLAN-T5 released with the [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) paper is an enhanced version of [T5](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) that has been finetuned on a combination of tasks. The paper explores instruction finetuning with a particular focus on scaling the number of tasks, scaling the model size, and finetuning on chain-of-thought data. The paper discovers that overall instruction finetuning is a general method that improves the performance and usability of pre-trained language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "![flan-t5 training](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363435475-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about the model, please check out [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416), original [repository](https://github.com/google-research/t5x), and Hugging Face [model card](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, to reduce the number of sentences required to be processed, you can perform grammatical correctness checking. This task should be considered as a simple binary text classification, where the model gets input text and predicts label 1 if a text contains any grammatical errors and 0 if it does not. You will use the [roberta-base-CoLA](https://huggingface.co/textattack/roberta-base-CoLA) model, the RoBERTa Base model finetuned on the CoLA dataset. The RoBERTa model was proposed in [RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692). It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pre-training objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates. Additional details about the model can be found in a [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/) by Meta AI and in the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta)\n",
