Human action recognition finds actions over time in a video. The list of actions in this notebook is extensive (400 in total) and covers *Person Actions*, (e.g., drawing, drinking, laughing), *Person-Person Actions* (e.g., hugging, shaking hands), and *Person-Object Actions* (opening present, mowing the lawn, playing "instrument"). You could find several parent-child groupings on the label's list, such as braiding hair and brushing hair, salsa dancing, robot dancing, or playing violin and playing guitar. For more information about the labels and dataset, see ["The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06950.pdf) research paper.

For best performance, we recommend installing the notebooks locally.*

## Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates live human action recognition with OpenVINO. We use the [Action Recognition Models](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_group_intel.html#action-recognition-models) from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo), specifically the Encoder and Decoder from [action-recognition-0001](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_model_action_recognition_0001.html) . Both models create a sequence to sequence (`"seq2seq"`)<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> system to identify the  human activities for [Kinetics-400 dataset](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics). The models use the Video Transformer approach with ResNet34 encoder<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. In the notebook we show how to create the following pipeline:

At the end of this notebook, you will see live inference results from your webcam. You can also upload a video file.

NOTE: _To use the webcam, you must run this Jupyter notebook on a computer with a webcam. If you run on a server, the webcam will not work. However, you can still do inference on a video in the final step._

<b id="f1">1</b> seq2seq: Deep learning models that take a sequence of items to the input and output. In this case, input: video frames, output: actions sequence. This `"seq2seq"` is composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder captures the `"context"` of the inputs to be analyzed by the decoder and finally gets the human action and confidence.[↩](#a1)
