# Visual-language assistant with Qwen2VL and OpenVINO

Qwen2VL is the latest addition to the QwenVL series of multimodal large language models.

**Key Enhancements of Qwen2VL:**
* **SoTA understanding of images of various resolution & ratio**: Qwen2-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual understanding benchmarks, including MathVista, DocVQA, RealWorldQA, MTVQA, etc.
* **Understanding videos of 20min+**: Qwen2-VL can understand videos over 20 minutes for high-quality video-based question answering, dialog, content creation, etc.
* **Agent that can operate your mobiles, robots, etc.:** with the abilities of complex reasoning and decision making, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices like mobile phones, robots, etc., for automatic operation based on visual environment and text instructions.
* **Multilingual Support:** to serve global users, besides English and Chinese, Qwen2-VL now supports the understanding of texts in different languages inside images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, etc.


**Model Architecture Details:**

* **Naive Dynamic Resolution**: Qwen2-VL can handle arbitrary image resolutions, mapping them into a dynamic number of visual tokens, offering a more human-like visual processing experience.

More details about model can be found in [model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct), [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-vl/) and original [repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL).

In this tutorial we consider how to convert and optimize Qwen2VL model for creating multimodal chatbot. Additionally, we demonstrate how to apply stateful transformation on LLM part and model optimization techniques like weights compression using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf)

## Notebook contents
The tutorial consists from following steps:

- Install requirements
- Convert and Optimize model
- Run OpenVINO model inference
- Launch Interactive demo

In this demonstration, you'll create interactive chatbot that can answer questions about provided image's content.

The image bellow illustrates example of input prompt and model answer.

## Installation instructions
This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
