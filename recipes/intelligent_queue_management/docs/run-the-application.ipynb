    "# Intelligent Queue Management with OpenVINO™\n",
    "\n",
    "An intelligent queue management system is a system that provides real-time insights to businesses to manage checkout queues in an intelligent and efficient way. The system can provide real-time information to customers about queue lengths and average customer count, allowing them to plan their time better. It can also optimize the use of resources, such as staff and equipment, to reduce wait times and increase customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing data such as wait times, queue lengths, and customer behavior, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their operations, reduce wait times, and improve the overall customer experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an intelligent queue management system that utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model, which can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). The system is designed to detect people in a video stream and count the number of individuals in a queue at any given time. By leveraging this real-time data on queue lengths and average customer count, the system can optimize queue management and reduce waiting times, ultimately leading to improved customer experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please to note that if you intend to use a webcam for this system, you will need to run the notebook on a computer with a built-in or external webcam. However, if you're running the notebook on a server, you can still perform inference on a pre-recorded video file.\n",

    "`queue_management()` is a function that uses the OpenVINO toolkit to perform object detection on a video file and count the number of customers in each zone based on the detected objects. It takes four arguments: the path to the video file, the path to the model file, the path to the JSON file containing the zone definitions, and the maximum number of customers allowed in a zone at any given time. The function displays the output video with the detected objects and zone annotations overlaid, and sends an alert notification to store management if any zones are over capacity.\n",
